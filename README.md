# Predictive Machine Learning Analytics for Telecom Customers Churn

### Introduction
This project aims to leverage machine learning analytics to predict customer churn in a telecom company. Customer churn, the loss of customers to competitors, can have a significant impact on a company's revenue and profitability. By developing a predictive model, we seek to proactively identify customers at risk of churning, allowing the telecom company to take targeted retention actions.

### Problem Statement
The telecom company is facing an issue of customer churn, and it's crucial to reduce it. We aim to develop a machine learning model that can predict which customers are likely to churn, based on historical data and customer attributes.

### Data Collection and Preprocessing
We collected historical customer data, including customer demographics, service usage, and billing information. Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical attributes. We also performed outlier detection and removed anomalies to ensure data quality.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA revealed key insights, including a correlation between contract length and churn rates. Visualizations illustrated customer distribution, contract types, and customer tenure. These insights guided feature engineering and model selection.
Feature Selection/Engineering
Feature engineering involved creating new variables, such as the ratio of total charges to total tenure, which proved to be a strong predictor of churn. Feature selection was performed to determine the most relevant attributes for the model.

### Model Selection and Training
We selected a range of classification models, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines. After careful evaluation and hyperparameter tuning, the Random Forest Classifier was chosen for its superior performance.

### Model Evaluation
The model was evaluated using common classification metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the ROC AUC. It achieved an accuracy of 86%, a precision of 80%, and a recall of 75%, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying potential churners.

### Results and Discussion
The predictive machine learning model successfully identifies customers at risk of churning, allowing the telecom company to target retention strategies effectively. While the model achieved notable results, it's important to acknowledge its limitations and the need for continuous improvement.

### Conclusion
This project showcases the potential of machine learning analytics to address customer churn challenges in the telecom industry. By leveraging predictive modeling, the telecom company can reduce customer churn, improve customer retention, and ultimately enhance its business performance.

### Future Work
Future work includes expanding the dataset, incorporating real-time data, and exploring advanced techniques like deep learning and ensemble methods. Additionally, implementing a systematic A/B testing framework to validate the model's effectiveness in a production environment is a key next step.
